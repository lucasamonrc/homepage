# 🏡 Homepage 

A tiny responsive website with my personal links, simple by design and built with the barebones of web technology (html, css, and javascript).

## 🎯 Justification

My online presence is dispersed through several different services such as LinkedIn, GitHub, YouTube, Substack, etc. I need a centralized place where I can direct people that want to connect with me. This tiny project fulfills this purpose by acting like a virtual business card and aggregating my main links into a single place where I can point people to visit.

## 🚀 Technology Stack

This website is simple by design. Often times developers over engineer their websites, and I am no exception; however, since I use a myriads of different software to build my online presence, building a hyper-complex website is unnecessary. My website uses the basic blocks of the web to have a layout structure, add styling, and implement behavior through html, css, and javascript respectively.
